This repository contains a Product Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display dynamic product data for a business. The dashboard fetches information from an external API using modern asynchronous techniques, including fetch(), .then(), async/await, and robust error handling with try and catch. The interface is enhanced with clean styling and interactive hover effects on product cards to improve user engagement and visual appeal. This project demonstrates practical experience with asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and front-end UI development for real-world data-driven applications.
